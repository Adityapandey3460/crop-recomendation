Project Name: Crop Prediction Model using ML

Description:
This project uses MACHINE Learning algorithm to predict the most suitable crop based on the given soil health, weather conditions and market trend. It helps farmers and agricultural planners make smart crop decisions based on environmental data.

Features:

Predicts best crop using ML algorithms.

Input features:

Nitrogen(N), Phosphorous(P), Potassium(K) values in (kg/ha)

Soil Humidity(%)

pH Value

Temperature (Â°C)

High accuracy with efficient performance

Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook / Python Script



Enter values for NPK values Humidity, pH, and Temperature when prompted.

Get the predicted crop as output.


Model Info:

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier,decisions tree, logistic regrassion.

Trained on labeled crop dataset

Evaluated for accuracy and performance

Future Improvements:

Add GUI for user-friendly interface

Include more features like rainfall, soil type

Deploy as a web or mobile app
