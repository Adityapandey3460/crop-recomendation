Project Name: Crop Prediction Model using ML

Description:
This project uses MACHINE Learning algorithm to predict the most suitable crop based on the given soil humidity, pH level, and temperature. It helps farmers and agricultural planners make smart crop decisions based on environmental data.

Features:

Predicts best crop using ML algorithms.

Input features:

NPK values

Soil Humidity

pH Value

Temperature

High accuracy with efficient performance

Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook / Python Script



Enter values for NPK values Humidity, pH, and Temperature when prompted.

Get the predicted crop as output.
