🌾 Crop Prediction Model using ML
This project leverages Machine Learning to predict the most suitable crop based on key agricultural inputs like soil nutrients, humidity, pH, and temperature. It empowers farmers and planners to make informed crop decisions using environmental data and market trends.

🔍 Features:
Predicts the best crop using Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression algorithms.

Takes user inputs for:

Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K) [kg/ha]

Soil Humidity [%]

pH Value

Temperature [°C]

High accuracy and performance on labeled crop datasets.

🛠 Technologies:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

🚀 Future Enhancements:
Add a user-friendly GUI

Include more features (rainfall, soil type)

Deploy as a web or mobile application
